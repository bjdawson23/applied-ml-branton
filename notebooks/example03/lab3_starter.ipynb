    "\n",
    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Howell dataset, here are the key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong Predictors (in order of importance):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Height**: The strongest single predictor of gender\n",
    "   - Achieved 71% accuracy using height alone\n",
    "   - Clear biological dimorphism between male and female heights\n",
    "   - Simple, interpretable relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Height + Weight Combined**: Most robust predictor set\n",
    "   - SVM achieved 77% accuracy using both features\n",
    "   - Decision Tree maintained 71% accuracy with both features\n",
    "   - Captures complementary aspects of physical dimorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weight**: Moderate predictor on its own\n",
    "   - Less reliable than height as a standalone predictor\n",
    "   - More variability due to lifestyle factors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree**: \n",
    "   - Training accuracy: 100% (clear overfitting)\n",
    "   - Test accuracy: 71% \n",
    "   - Excellent interpretability but prone to overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:\n",
    "   - Best overall performance: 77% test accuracy\n",
    "   - More robust to overfitting\n",
    "   - Good balance of precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neural Network**:\n",
    "   - Poor performance: 53% accuracy (worse than random guessing)\n",
    "   - Failed to converge properly on this small dataset\n",
    "   - Overly complex for the available data size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Height emerges as the most reliable single predictor** due to consistent sexual dimorphism\n",
    "- **SVM performs best overall**, handling the feature combination more effectively\n",
    "- **Simple models work better** than complex ones for this small dataset (346 adults)\n",
    "- **Overfitting is a major concern** - all models show significant training vs. test performance gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2 Discuss Challenges Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "    Small sample size could limit generalizability.\n",
    "    Missing values (if any) could bias the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.3 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test more features (e.g., BMI class).\n",
