## Folders for Projects

Each project will be completed in its own folder.

- notebooks/project01 folder:
  - ml01.ipynb - COMPLETE THIS
  - ml01.py - working script with just the code
  - README.md - instructions - modify this to present your lab project

## Update this README as you work

Add commands to run additional scripts as you work through the course (update the path and file name as needed).

### 3.5 Git add-commit-push to GitHub

Anytime we make working changes to code is a good time to git add-commit-push to GitHub.

1. Stage your changes with git add.
2. Commit your changes with a useful message in quotes.
3. Push your work to GitHub.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "describe your change in quotes"
git push -u origin main
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and publish your documentation via GitHub Pages.

### 3.6 Modify and Debug

With a working version safe in GitHub, start making changes to the code.

Before starting a new session, remember to do a `git pull` and keep your tools updated.

Each time forward progress is made, remember to git add-commit-push.
